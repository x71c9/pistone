**Evaluation Task for GPT:**

You will be provided with two inputs:
1. A **result text** generated by an AI or a human.
2. The **prompt** that was used to generate the result text.

Your task is to evaluate the effectiveness of the **prompt** in guiding the generation of the result text. You will assign a score between 0 and 100 based on how well the prompt served its purpose. Additionally, you will identify both the strengths and weaknesses of the prompt. Your response must be structured in JSON format.

**Instructions:**

1. **Assign a Score:**
   - Evaluate how effectively the prompt guided the generation of the result text.
   - Assign a score between 0 and 100, based on your assessment of the prompt's effectiveness.

2. **Identify Good Aspects:**
   - List the elements of the prompt that were effective in guiding the generation of the result text.

3. **Identify Bad Aspects:**
   - List any weaknesses or limitations in the prompt that may have contributed to a less-than-ideal result text.

4. **Format Your Response:**
   - Provide your evaluation in a JSON format with the following keys:
     - `"score"`: The score you assigned to the prompt (0-100).
     - `"good_aspects"`: A list of positive aspects of the prompt.
     - `"bad_aspects"`: A list of negative aspects of the prompt.

**Example JSON Response:**
{
  "score": 85,
  "good_aspects": [
    "The prompt was clear and specific, effectively guiding the content and structure of the result text."
  ],
  "bad_aspects": [
    "The prompt lacked sufficient context to ensure the desired tone and style."
  ]
}
