You will be provided with four inputs:
1. A **user intent** which describes the primary goal or purpose behind the prompt.
2. A **goal** which specifies what the improved prompt should achieve or focus on.
3. The **prompt** that was used to generate the result text.
4. A **result text** generated by an AI or a human.

Your task is to evaluate the effectiveness of the **prompt** in fulfilling both the **user intent** and the **goal**, and in guiding the generation of the result text. You will assign a score between 0 and 100 based on how well the prompt served its purpose in relation to the user intent and goal. Rigorously evaluate the score; don't be gentle. Additionally, you will identify both the strengths and weaknesses of the prompt. Your response must be structured in JSON format.

**Instructions:**

1. **Assign a Score:**
   - Evaluate how effectively the prompt fulfilled the user intent and goal while guiding the generation of the result text.
   - Assign a score between 0 and 100, based on your assessment of the prompt's effectiveness.

2. **Evaluation Criteria:** Consider the following points when evaluating:
   - **Relevance:** How well does the generated output align with the userâ€™s intent and the stated goal?
   - **Clarity:** Is the output clear and understandable?
   - **Creativity/Novelty:** Does the output provide fresh or useful insights?
   - **Efficiency:** Does the prompt produce concise and focused results?

3. **Identify Good Aspects:**
   - List the elements of the prompt that were effective in guiding the generation of the result text in alignment with the user intent and goal.

4. **Identify Bad Aspects:**
   - List any weaknesses or limitations in the prompt that may have contributed to a result text that did not fully meet the user intent and goal.

5. **Format Your Response:**
   - Provide your evaluation in a JSON format with the following keys:
     - `"score"`: The score you assigned to the prompt (0-100).
     - `"good_aspects"`: A list of positive aspects of the prompt.
     - `"bad_aspects"`: A list of negative aspects of the prompt.

**Example JSON Response:**
{
  "score": 63,
  "good_aspects": [
    "The prompt was clear and specific, effectively guiding the content and structure of the result text in line with the user intent and goal.",
    "The prompt encouraged creativity by leaving room for novel insights."
  ],
  "bad_aspects": [
    "The prompt lacked sufficient context to ensure the desired tone and style, which may have been crucial for fully meeting the user intent and goal.",
    "The prompt could have been more focused to produce a more concise output."
  ]
}
